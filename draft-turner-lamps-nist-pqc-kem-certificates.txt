1.  Introduction

   The US NIST PQC competition has selected the Candidate 1 and
   Candidate 2 algorithms as winners of their PQC competition [PQCComp].
   These algorithms are KEM algorithms.  NIST has also defined object
   identifiers for these algorithms (TODO insert reference).

   This document specifies the use of the Candidate 1 and Candidate 2
   algorithms in X.509 public key certifiates, see [RFC5280].  It also
   specifies private key encoding.  An ASN.1 module is included for
   reference purposes.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Algorithm Identifiers

   Certificates conforming to [RFC5280] can convey a public key for any
   public key algorithm.  The certificate indicates the algorithm
   through an algorithm identifier.  An algorithm identifier consists of
   an object identifier and optional parameters.

   The AlgorithmIdentifier type, which is included herein for
   convenience, is defined as follows:

   AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE { algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
   parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }

      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5280] and matches the
      |  version used therein, i.e., the 1988 ASN.1 syntax.  See
      |  [RFC5912] for ASN.1 copmatible with the 2015 ASN.1 syntax.

   The fields in AlgorithmIdentifier have the following meanings:

   *  algorithm identifies the cryptographic algorithm with an object
      identifier.  XXX such OIDs are defined in Sections Section 4 and
      Section 5.

   *  parameters, which are optional, are the associated parameters for
      the algorithm identifier in the algorithm field.

   In this document, TODO (specify number) new OIDs for identifying the
   different algorithm and parameter pairs.  For all of the object
   identifiers, the parameters MUST be absent.

   It is possible to find systems that require the parameters to be
   present.  This can be due to either a defect in the original 1997
   syntax or a programming error where developers never got input where
   this was not true.  The optimal solution is to fix these systems;
   where this is not possible, the problem needs to be restricted to
   that subsystem and not propagated to the Internet.

4.  Candidate 1

   TODO insert object-identifiers

5.  Candidate 2

   TODO insert object identifiers

6.  Subject Public Key Fields

   In the X.509 certificate, the subjectPublicKeyInfo field has the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, which has the following ASN.1 syntax:

     SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
         algorithm         AlgorithmIdentifier,
         subjectPublicKey  BIT STRING
     }

      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5280] and matches the
      |  version used therein, i.e., the 1988 ASN.1 syntax.  See
      |  [RFC5912] for ASN.1 copmatible with the 2015 ASN.1 syntax.

   The fields in SubjectPublicKeyInfo have the following meanings:

   *  algorithm is the algorithm identifier and parameters for the
      public key (see above).

   *  subjectPublicKey contains the byte stream of the public key.  The
      algorithms defined in this document always encode the public key
      as TODO pick format e.g., exact multiple of 8 bits?.

   The following is an example of a TBD public key encoded using the
   textual encoding defined in [RFC7468].

     -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
     TODO insert example public key
     -----END PUBLIC KEY-------

7.  Key Usage Bits

   The intended application for the key is indicated in the keyUsage
   certificate extension; see Section 4.2.1.3 of [RFC5280].

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates
   Candidate 1 or Candidate 2 in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the
   following MUST be present:

     keyEncipherment;

   all of the following MUST be present:

     encipherOnly; or
     decipherOnly.

8.  Private Key Format

   "Asymmetric Key Packages" [RFC5958] describes how to encode a private
   key in a structure that both identifies what algorithm the private
   key is for and allows for the public key and additional attributes
   about the key to be included as well.  For illustration, the ASN.1
   structure OneAsymmetricKey is replicated below.  The algorithm-
   specific details of how a private key is encoded are left for the
   document describing the algorithm itself.

     OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
         version                  Version,
         privateKeyAlgorithm      PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier,
         privateKey               PrivateKey,
         attributes           [0] IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL,
         ...,
         [[2: publicKey       [1] IMPLICIT PublicKey OPTIONAL ]],
         ...
     }

     PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING

     PublicKey ::= BIT STRING

      |  NOTE: The above syntax is from [RFC5958] and matches the
      |  version used therein, i.e., the 2002 ASN.1 syntax.  The syntax
      |  used therein is compatible with the 2015 ASN.1 syntax.

   For the keys defined in this document, the private key is always an
   opaque byte sequence.  The ASN.1 type PqckemPrivateKey is defined in
   this document to hold the byte sequence.  Thus, when encoding a
   OneAsymmetricKey object, the private key is wrapped in a
   PqckemPrivateKey object and wrapped by the OCTET STRING of the
   "privateKey" field.

     PqckemPrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING

   The following is an example of a TBD private key encoded using the
   textual encoding defined in [RFC7468].

     -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
     TODO iser example private key
     -----END PRIVATE KEY-------

   The following example, in addition to encoding the TBD private key,
   has an attribute included as well as the public key.  As with the
   prior example, the textual encoding defined in [RFC7468] is used.

     -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
     TODO insert example private key with attribute
     -----END PRIVATE KEY-------

      |  NOTE: There exist some private key import functions that have
      |  not implemented the new ASN.1 structure OneAsymmetricKey that
      |  is defined in [RFC5958].  This means that they will not accept
      |  a private key structure that contains the public key field.
      |  This means a balancing act needs to be done between being able
      |  to do a consistency check on the key pair and widest ability to
      |  import the key.
